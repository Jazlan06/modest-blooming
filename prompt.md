Description :
1. Planning & Requirements Breakdown

List Features: Break down your requirements into smaller features/modules. For example:

User Authentication (Login, Signup, Forgot Password)

Product Management (CRUD products, categories, colors)

Coupon Management

Order Management (Cart, Wishlist, Checkout, Order Tracking)

CMS Content Management (Home page content, banners, sales)

Analytics & Reports

Payment Integration (Indian UPI)

UI Components (Header, Footer, Product Cards, Sliders)

Data Modeling: Sketch your MongoDB schema designs. At minimum:

User Schema

Product Schema (with images, colors, categories, price, quantity)

Coupon Schema

Order Schema

CMS Content Schema (for homepage, banners, etc.)

Analytics Schema (tracking orders, sales, user activity)

2. Tech Stack Setup

Initialize your backend with Node.js + Express and MongoDB.

Use Mongoose for schema modeling and DB interactions.

Setup authentication using JWT or Passport.js.

For images, integrate Cloudinary for uploads and storage.

Initialize frontend with Vite + React + Tailwind CSS.

Plan component hierarchy: common UI components (Header, Footer), pages, and reusable components (Product Card, Slider, Filters).

3. Start Backend API Development

Build out the core APIs first:

User Authentication (register/login/forgot password)

Product CRUD APIs (including image upload handling with Cloudinary)

Coupon CRUD APIs

Order APIs (create order, update order status)

CMS APIs (update home page content, banners, sales)

Test APIs with tools like Postman as you build.

4. Build Admin Panel (CMS)

Start with a separate frontend project or admin routes inside the main frontend.

Implement authentication for the admin panel.

Build forms/pages for managing:

Products (with image uploads)

Coupons

Home page content (banners, sales info)

Order status updates

Analytics dashboards (can be simple charts with a library like Chart.js)

5. Frontend User Website

After backend APIs and CMS admin panel are stable, start the customer-facing website.

Implement:

Homepage (dynamic content from CMS)

Shop page with filters and product listings

Product detail page (image slider, colors, quantity selector)

Cart and Wishlist features (state management with Context API or Redux)

Checkout with UPI payment integration (e.g., Razorpay, PhonePe, or Paytm APIs)

6. Integrate Payment Gateway

Research and choose an Indian UPI-compatible payment gateway.

Implement payment in the checkout flow with proper verification and order confirmation.

7. Testing & Optimization

Write unit and integration tests for critical parts.

Test UI responsiveness and cross-browser compatibility.

Optimize API performance and frontend loading times.

8. Deployment

Deploy backend on services like Heroku, AWS, or DigitalOcean.

Deploy frontend on Vercel, Netlify, or similar.

Connect your domain and set up SSL certificates.

## Prompt

Okay now we gonna implement the logic for delivery rate calculation beased on total cart weight & location. Lets do the delivery rate calculation logic first. So we gonna take address of user state, city, pincode, locality(like i live in mazgaon, dockyard), street address, apartmennt/house address. Business is located at Dockyard Road, mumbai - so delivery agent gave me this rate :
1. Mumbai, Navi Mumbai, Thane & nearby - 50/kg.
2. Whole Maharashtra Except (1) - 60/kg.
3. Whole Gujrat - 70/kg
4. Rest nearby states - 80/kg
5. North & North East(like jammu&kashmir, manipur,etc) - 140/kg
6. where they cant reach(1-4) they'll do dtdc - 100/kg .
:
so the weight will be calculated for each product & it's quantity, if the customers neeed a hamper an additional 0.25kg will be added in end weight with products. Then total weight will be calculated and based on user location delivery rate will be applicable. If the total weight sums up 1.05 kg as example it will be calculated as 2 kg means anything above 1 kg will be calculated 2kg and anything above 2kg will be calculated 3 kg and hence.
